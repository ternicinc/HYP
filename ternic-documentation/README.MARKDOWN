# Readme

Welcome to the documentation of the ternic source code, this documumentation will hold the entire
operating systems working, and how we are designing it. Together with why we make certain stuff the way
they are.

Let's start with a general introduction to TernicOS. Ive always wanted to make my own operating system,
and make it properly and readable, but not only that, I wanted to add the features that other operating
systems lack, and make an operating sytsem with both the strengths of Linux and BSD. This is when i 
decided to make TernicOS, a safe, fast, and useful operating system.

TernicOS has 2 'modes', one of which is server and the other one is desktop. We are starting with the server
since that was the initial goal, me and my team were always pasionated about servers and how they work,
so this was also for sure something that played along.
